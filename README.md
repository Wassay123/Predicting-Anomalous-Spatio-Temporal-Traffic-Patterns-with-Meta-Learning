# Predicting Spatio-Temporal Traffic Patterns in New York City

## Project Overview

This research project aims to develop advanced predictive models that utilize a meta-learning approach to understand and forecast spatio-temporal traffic patterns across New York City. By integrating deep learning techniques and leveraging large datasets encompassing various temporal and geographical variables, this initiative seeks to provide insights that can assist in urban planning, traffic management, and policy-making.

Traffic congestion in urban areas not only causes daily inconvenience but also affects air quality, economic productivity, and accessibility. With New York City's complex traffic dynamics, there is a significant need for more accurate and timely traffic predictions to inform decision-making processes. This project uses multi-input convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and custom layers to handle diverse data inputs, reflecting different times of the year and distinct geographic traffic behaviors within the city.

## Research Objectives

- **Model Development**: To design and refine deep learning models capable of capturing complex patterns in traffic data.
- **Data Analysis**: To analyze historical traffic data to identify trends, anomalies, and predictors of traffic flow.
- **Predictive Accuracy**: To improve the accuracy and reliability of traffic predictions to aid real-time traffic management systems.
- **Meta-Learning Application**: To explore the effectiveness of meta-learning in adapting models to changes in traffic patterns without needing retraining from scratch.

## Expected Impact

The outcomes of this research are expected to contribute to smarter city initiatives by providing tools that can predict and thus mitigate traffic-related issues before they occur. Enhanced predictive capabilities will enable city planners and relevant authorities to deploy resources more efficiently, improve traffic flow, reduce environmental impact, and enhance the quality of life for residents and visitors of New York City.

This repository serves as a hub for all project-related code, datasets, and documentation. It is structured to facilitate collaboration, ensure transparency of the research process, and disseminate findings to the broader community.
